# Micro-Donations-Pool
Creating a donation pool with a withdrawal function for charity and collects donations into a common pool.
---
The Micro Donations Pool is a blockchain-based platform designed to simplify the process of collecting small donations and channeling them to charitable causes. Built using Solidity, the project leverages the transparency and security of blockchain technology to ensure that every contribution is securely recorded and can be tracked in real time. The primary goal is to create a decentralized, trustless environment where individuals can donate small amounts of cryptocurrency that accumulate into a common pool. The collected funds are then withdrawn by the contract owner and transferred to registered charitable organizations.

This project is designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind. It requires no input fields during deployment and eliminates the need for complex setups. The contract is minimalistic, ensuring low deployment and operational costs on the blockchain. The contractâ€™s design adheres to best practices, ensuring that only the designated owner can withdraw funds, thereby preventing unauthorized access.
