# 🪙 Micro Donations Pool

## 📜 Project Description  
The **Micro Donations Pool** is a blockchain-based platform designed to simplify the process of collecting small cryptocurrency donations and channeling them to charitable causes. Built using **Solidity**, the project leverages blockchain’s transparency and security to ensure that every contribution is securely recorded and can be tracked in real time.  

The primary goal is to create a decentralized, trustless environment where individuals can donate small amounts of cryptocurrency that accumulate into a common pool. The collected funds are then withdrawn by the contract owner and transferred to registered charitable organizations.  

This project is designed with simplicity and efficiency in mind:  
- ✅ No input fields are required during deployment.  
- ✅ Minimalistic design ensures low deployment and operational costs.  
- ✅ Only the designated contract owner can withdraw funds, ensuring security and preventing unauthorized access.
